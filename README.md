# tableau-challenge

This repository holds most of the additional files utilized to create the tableau visualizations, as well as a fully written analysis. Some files were to large to be added to this repository. These files include the .twbx file that would hold the Tableau workbook, and the original data utilized (202210-citibike-tripdata.csv).

A link to the Tableau Public site which houses the visualizations is included here:
